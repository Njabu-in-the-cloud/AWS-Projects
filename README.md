# AWS-Projects by Nonjabulo Kubheka

This repository is a collection of my AWS Cloud Computing projects and learning progress.  
I’m building my cloud portfolio as I transition into a career in **cloud computing and DevOps**.  

Each folder in this repo contains a hands-on AWS project — designed to apply cloud concepts, experiment with AWS services, and follow **AWS Well-Architected Framework** best practices.
